# Reset Password Functionality - Client Implementation

## Overview
The reset password functionality has been implemented on the client side with a complete 3-step flow:

### 1. Email Input Step
- User enters their email address
- System validates email format
- Sends OTP to the provided email

### 2. OTP Verification Step
- User enters the 6-digit OTP received via email
- System validates OTP and provides reset token
- Includes resend functionality with 60-second countdown

### 3. Password Reset Step
- User enters new password and confirmation
- System validates password strength and confirmation match
- Resets password and redirects to login

## Implementation Details

### AuthContext Updates
Added three new functions to the AuthContext:
- `forgotPassword(email: string)` - Requests password reset OTP
- `verifyResetOtp(email: string, otp: string)` - Verifies OTP and gets reset token
- `resetPassword(resetToken: string, newPassword: string)` - Resets password

### Forgot Password Page (`/forgot`)
- **Location**: `client/app/(user)/forgot/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Multi-step form with smooth transitions
  - Real-time validation
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Countdown timer for OTP resend
  - Responsive design with modern UI

### Login Integration
- Updated Login component includes "Forgot Password?" link
- Seamless navigation between login and reset flow

## User Flow

### Step 1: Request Reset
1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. System sends OTP to email
4. User proceeds to OTP verification

### Step 2: Verify OTP
1. User enters 6-digit OTP from email
2. System verifies OTP
3. If valid, user proceeds to password reset
4. If invalid, user can resend OTP (60s cooldown)

### Step 3: Reset Password
1. User enters new password (min 6 characters)
2. User confirms new password
3. System validates password match
4. Password is reset and user is redirected to login

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites
1. Backend server running on `http://localhost:8080`
2. Redis server running for email queuing
3. Email configuration set up in backend `.env`
4. bcrypt package installed in backend

### Test Steps

#### 1. Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client
npm run dev
```

#### 2. Test the Flow
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter a valid email address
4. Check email for OTP
5. Enter the OTP in the verification step
6. Enter new password and confirmation
7. Verify redirect to login page

### API Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password` - Request OTP
- `POST /api/v1/auth/verify-reset-otp` - Verify OTP
